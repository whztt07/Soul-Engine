Algorithm: void tesselate(const char * fName, float detail)

Extract Obj from file		//ExtractFromFile(fName) 

Convert extracted data to custom Triangles class format

get iterator to beginning of triangles

define metric as a boolean condition based on the current triangle or set of triangles - to be decided



while metric has not been satisfied:
	get triangles current iterator is pointing to

	get midpoints of all triangle verticies

	create 4 new triangles from the from the existing triangle using the midpoints like shown below:

/*
			^
		   / \
		  /   \
		 /.....\
		/  x x  \
		____x____  

	Note that the above is a depiction and not to scale
*/

	Insert 4 new triangles at end of list
	
	remove original triangle (advancing iterator to next triangle)
